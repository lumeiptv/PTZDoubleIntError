PTZ STRATEGY - ERROR PREVENTION & SCALPING OPTIMIZATION
========================================================

CRITICAL FIX - Strategy Will No Longer Shut Down on Errors:
-----------------------------------------------------------
✓ Changed RealtimeErrorHandling from StopCancelClose to IgnoreAllErrors
  - Strategy will continue running even if it encounters stop order errors
  - All errors are logged but don't stop execution

Enhanced Error Handling:
------------------------
✓ Added try-catch blocks around ALL SetStopLoss calls
✓ Added try-catch blocks around SetProfitTarget calls
✓ Added try-catch blocks around SetTrailStop calls
✓ Errors are logged to output but strategy continues

Improved Stop Validation Logic:
-------------------------------
✓ Simplified TrySetStopLoss - returns false if stop is invalid instead of throwing errors
✓ Better bid/ask validation with extra 3-tick buffer
✓ Stops only update when they improve position (never worsen)

NEW SCALPING-OPTIMIZED PARAMETERS:
==================================

Contract 1 (Quick Scalp Settings):
----------------------------------
Initial Trailing Stop: 15 ticks (was 30)
Step 1: 12 ticks at 10 ticks profit (was 25 @ 20)
Step 2: 10 ticks at 20 ticks profit (was 20 @ 40)
Step 3: 8 ticks at 30 ticks profit (was 15 @ 60)

Contract 2 (Aggressive Runner):
-------------------------------
Initial Trailing Stop: 12 ticks (was 20)
Step 1: 10 ticks at 15 ticks profit (was 15 @ 30)
Step 2: 8 ticks at 25 ticks profit (was 10 @ 50)
Step 3: 6 ticks at 40 ticks profit (was 8 @ 80)

Basic Stop/Target Settings:
---------------------------
Stop Loss: 15 ticks (was 20)
Profit Target: 20 ticks (was 40)
Trail Stop: 15 ticks (was 30)
Minimum Stop Distance: 5 ticks (was 10)

WHAT THIS MEANS:
===============
• Strategy takes profits faster - optimized for quick in/out scalping
• Stops are tighter but more responsive
• Strategy WILL NOT shut down on errors anymore
• All errors are logged so you can see what happened
• If a stop can't be placed, it skips that update and tries again next bar

TESTING RECOMMENDATION:
======================
1. Start with 1 contract to test (EnableMultiContract = false)
2. Monitor the output window for any logged errors
3. If you see repeated stop errors, increase MinimumStopDistanceTicks by 1-2 ticks
4. Once stable with 1 contract, enable multi-contract if desired
